using (...value):{
    The use of the spread operator (...) in the line const newUser = await User.create({...value, password: hashedPassword}) 
    
    is a common JavaScript pattern that allows you to create a new object by copying properties from an existing object and 
    
    adding or overriding properties in the new object.
}

using (req.user){
    req.user is nothing but a custom key of req object.

    Which can be inserted from any route by pointing req object.

    But generally, it is inserted from the authorization middleware where we compare user by the token. (JWT).

    So req.user can be accessible in all the root where authorization middleware is called.

    Note: You can put any data in it and also with a different key like req.body.yourKey
}


using (error.details[0].message){
    details[0] typically contains a human-readable description of what went wrong.
    
     For example, it might say something like "Email is required" or
    
     "Password must be at least 6 characters long."
